Stock Move Extra Products Supply
################################

The stock_move_extra_products_supply module allows to add several extra
products in a shipment/production line from which purchase request of these
products will be created. These extra products are usually additional
services that apply to the product actually sent/received.

It also allows to add several extra products in inputs and outputs of bills of
materials (BOM). And there is a wizard in productions to take the extra
products from the BOM to the production inputs and outputs.
